# What is Brain Tumor? ðŸ“š

A brain tumor, known as an intracranial tumor, is an abnormal mass of tissue in which cells grow and multiply uncontrollably, seemingly unchecked by the mechanisms that control normal cells.

# Show segments of tumor using different effects
Our project brings tumor analysis to life by displaying tumor segments using a variety of creative visual effects. Witness the boundaries of tumors highlighted in distinct ways, providing medical professionals with a dynamic and insightful perspective for accurate diagnosis.

# Show whole nifti data and print each slice from 3d data
Comprehensive 3D Data Display: To provide a holistic view of our NIfTI brain tumor data, we've incorporated a feature that displays each slice from the 3D dataset. By iterating through the slices and printing them individually, we enable a comprehensive examination of the entire volume. This approach grants medical practitioners the ability to analyze the tumor's progression through the slices, aiding in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.
