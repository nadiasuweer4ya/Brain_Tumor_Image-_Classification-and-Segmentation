**What is Brain Tumor?**

A brain tumor, known as an intracranial tumor, is an abnormal mass of tissue in which cells grow and multiply uncontrollably, seemingly unchecked by the mechanisms that control normal cells.

# Show segments of tumor using different effects
Our project brings tumor analysis to life by displaying tumor segments using a variety of creative visual effects. Witness the boundaries of tumors highlighted in distinct ways, providing medical professionals with a dynamic and insightful perspective for accurate diagnosis.

# Show whole nifti data and print each slice from 3d data
Comprehensive 3D Data Display: To provide a holistic view of our NIfTI brain tumor data, we've incorporated a feature that displays each slice from the 3D dataset. By iterating through the slices and printing them individually, we enable a comprehensive examination of the entire volume. This approach grants medical practitioners the ability to analyze the tumor's progression through the slices, aiding in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

# All BraTS multimodal scans are available as NIfTI files (.nii.gz) and of 4 modalities as follows:
T1: T1-weighted, native image, sagittal or axial 2D acquisitions, with 1â€“6 mm slice
thickness.
T1c: T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced (Gadolinium) image, with 3D acquisition and 1
mm isotropic voxel size for most patients.
T2: T2-weighted image, axial 2D acquisition, with 2â€“6 mm slice thickness.
FLAIR : T2-weighted FLAIR image, axial, coronal, or sagittal 2D acquisitions, 2â€“6 mm
slice thickness.
All images were acquired with different clinical protocols and various scanners from multiple
(n=19) institutions, mentioned as data contributors here. All the imaging datasets have been
segmented manually , by one to four raters, following the same annotation protocol, and their
annotations were approved by experienced neuro-radiologists. Annotations comprise
